1. see if we can get the import pathing in the commons/__tests__ folder to resolve.
  do we need a root level tsconfig and package.json?
2. go over the universe tests before checking in - vitest config, import paths, etc.
3. figure out where this root node_modules is coming from
4. review agents folder and .claude folder
5. make sure we can debug in vitest and all projects we add
6. do we need the package.json in the commons folder?
